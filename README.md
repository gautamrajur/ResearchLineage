# ResearchLineage
LLM Powered Research Lineage and Path Tracker - enables users to research in the fastest time possible

We're not replacing comprehensive literature reviews or deep reading (that's impossible!). We're the Wikipedia of research lineages, a starting point that helps researchers get oriented 10x faster, so they can read the right papers in the right order with the right context. Researchers don't need another tool that replaces reading. They need a tool that makes reading more strategic. We provide the map before the journey.
