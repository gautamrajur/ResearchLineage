# ResearchLineage — LLM-Powered Research Lineage & Path Tracker

> *"We're not replacing comprehensive literature reviews. We're the Wikipedia of research lineages — a starting point that helps researchers get oriented 10x faster, so they can read the right papers in the right order with the right context."*

Given a seed paper ID, this pipeline crawls the Semantic Scholar citation graph, validates and cleans the data, builds a directed citation network, engineers influence features, detects anomalies, and writes structured results to a PostgreSQL database — all orchestrated by Apache Airflow running locally via Docker Compose, backed by GCP (Cloud SQL + GCS) and versioned with DVC. Three DAGs cover the full workflow: citation network analysis, fine-tuning data generation for Llama 3.1 8B, and a standalone PDF retry handler.

## Architecture

Three Airflow DAGs, all running locally via Docker Compose:

| DAG | Tasks | Operator | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| `research_lineage_pipeline` | 11 + parallel pdf_upload | PythonOperator | Manual |
| `fine_tuning_pipeline` | 8 sequential | BashOperator | Manual |
| `retry_failed_pdfs` | 1 | PythonOperator | Manual |

![All three DAGs in Airflow UI](docs/screenshots/Three-different-DAGS.png)

### `research_lineage_pipeline` — 11-task flow

```
[T0]  schema_validation         — verify PostgreSQL tables exist
        ↓
[T1]  data_acquisition          — Semantic Scholar API crawl (async, depth-limited BFS)
        ↓                      ↘
[T2]  data_validation            [pdf_upload] → GCS   ← parallel branch, 120-min timeout
        ↓
[T3]  data_cleaning
        ↓
[T4]  citation_graph_construction
        ↓
[T5]  feature_engineering
        ↓
[T7]  schema_transformation
        ↓
[T8]  quality_validation         — 300–500 checks; ≥85% required
        ↓
[T9]  anomaly_detection          — Z-score > 3 outliers + email alert
        ↓
[T10] database_write             — upsert to Cloud SQL via Auth Proxy
        ↓
[T11] report_generation          — JSON stats report (papers, authors, citations, year range)
```

Inter-task data passes through Airflow **XCom**. The NetworkX graph is not serialised to XCom; only derived metrics are pushed downstream.

**Config:** `max_active_runs=1`, `retries=3`, `retry_delay=5m`, `execution_timeout=60m` (pdf_upload: 120m).

---

## Data Acquisition

**Sources:** Semantic Scholar (primary — metadata, citation intent, influence flags), arXiv (full-text HTML fallback), OpenAlex (API fallback when S2 rate-limits), Google Gemini (comparison pair generation, DAG 2 only).

**Three-layer caching:** Redis (48h TTL, ~60–70% hit) → PostgreSQL (permanent, ~20–30% hit) → live API. Combined live API miss rate: 10–20%.

**Inline filtering** runs before recursive BFS calls with the following criteria:
- Citation intent must be `methodology` or `background`, **or** the paper is marked `isInfluential` by Semantic Scholar
- Papers are scored: base citation count + **+10K** (influential) + **+5K** (methodology intent)
- Top N papers taken per depth level — adaptive: 5 at depth 0–1, 3 at depth 2, 2 at depth 3+

Result: **98% reduction in API calls** (10,000+ → 100–150 per run).

**Output:** JSONL with `instruction`, `prompt`, `response`, and `metadata` (paper IDs, years, citations, fields, depth, lineage chain). Supports `backward` / `forward` / `both` traversal. State file enables resume; fixed random seed ensures reproducibility.

---

## Data Preprocessing

### DAG 1 — Tasks 2–5

| Task | Key details |
|---|---|
| **T2 — Data Validation** | Schema, field presence, type/range checks; >10% error rate raises `ValidationError` and halts |
| **T3 — Data Cleaning** | Text normalisation, venue standardisation, deduplication, self-citation removal; ~80% of raw edges filtered |
| **T4 — Citation Graph** | NetworkX `DiGraph`; PageRank (α = 0.85), betweenness centrality, in/out-degree, connected components |
| **T5 — Feature Engineering** | Citation velocity, recency score, temporal category, years-from-target, composite influence score |

### DAG 2 — Preprocessing steps

- **preprocessing:** validates JSONL, drops malformed records
- **repair_lineage_chains:** reconstructs missing metadata via shared paper ID cross-reference
- **split + convert:** separates pairs from metadata sidecars; converts to Qwen 2.5-7B chat format

---

## Schema & Statistics Generation

The pipeline automates schema verification and statistics generation at three points:

**T0 — Schema Validation:** `SchemaValidationTask` verifies all required PostgreSQL tables exist before any data is fetched. Fails fast if the schema is missing or incomplete.

**T8 — Quality Validation:** `QualityValidationTask` runs 300–500 checks across schema compliance, statistical properties, referential integrity, and distribution balance. A score below **85%** raises `DataQualityError` and halts before writing to the database.

![Quality validation score: 99.8% (445/446 checks passed)](docs/screenshots/Quality-Score-for-Data-Validation.png)

| Dimension | Check | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **Temporal** | No single era > 50% of papers | 5 eras: pre-2000, 2000–2010, 2010–2015, 2015–2020, 2020+ |
| **Citation** | Distribution across high/medium/low cited papers | Flags if >70% high-citation |
| **Venue** | No single venue type > 60% | top-conference, arXiv, journal |

**T11 — Report Generation:** After each successful run, `ReportGenerationTask` produces a JSON statistics report: total papers, authors, citations, papers-by-year, top venues, citation stats, year range.

![Database stats report: 64 papers, 291 authors, 82 citations, 1951–2025](docs/screenshots/Database-Stats-report.png)

---

## Pipeline Flow Optimization

**Inline filtering** cuts API calls from 10,000+ (~6 h hypothetical) to 100–150 per run (2–3 min) — 98% reduction.

**Parallelisation:** after `data_acquisition`, `pdf_upload` branches off concurrently (120-min timeout) without blocking the main chain.

**Gantt analysis** pinpointed `data_acquisition` as the bottleneck. After enabling caching + filtering: **6m 02s → 3m 15s (46% faster)**, with `database_write` no longer timing out. Steady state: <5 min e2e, 60–80% cache hit rate, 95%+ task success.

Below — pre-optimization Gantt showing `data_acquisition` at **6m 02s**:

![Before optimization: data_acquisition run duration 6m 02s](docs/screenshots/Before-pipeline-optimization.png)

After — `data_acquisition` down to **3m 15s** (46% faster), all downstream tasks finish in seconds:

![After optimization: Gantt view, data_acquisition run duration 3m 15s](docs/screenshots/With-pipeline-optimization.jpeg)

---

## Anomaly Detection & Alerting

`AnomalyDetectionTask` (T9) detects the following anomaly types:

| Type | Detection method |
|---|---|
| Missing data (abstracts, years, venues) | Field presence check on every record |
| Statistical outliers (citation counts) | Z-score > 3 |
| Citation anomalies (self-citations, duplicates) | Post-cleaning verification pass |
| Disconnected papers (zero in/out degree) | Graph connectivity scan |
| API rate limit threshold breaches | Request counter threshold monitoring |

When `total_anomalies > 0`, an email alert is sent via `EmailService` (`src/utils/email_service.py`) — methods: `send_alert`, `send_pipeline_success`, `send_pipeline_error`.

![Airflow logs: 17 anomalies detected, email sent](docs/screenshots/Anamoly-detection.png)

![Anomaly alert email in Gmail: 17 issues detected](docs/screenshots/Anamoly-alert-mail.png)

**Sample alert:**

```
Subject: ResearchLineage Anomaly Alert — 5 issue(s) detected

Anomaly detection found 5 issue(s) in pipeline run.
Target paper: 204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776

Breakdown:
  missing_data.missing_abstracts: 2
  missing_data.missing_venues: 1
  citation_anomalies.duplicate_citations: 1
  disconnected_papers.disconnected_papers: 1

Check the Airflow logs for full details.
```

Alerts are **silently skipped** if SMTP credentials are not configured — the pipeline continues normally.

**Gmail setup:** Enable 2-Step Verification → generate an App Password at `myaccount.google.com/apppasswords` → use the 16-character code as `SMTP_PASSWORD`.

---

## Bias Detection & Mitigation (DAG 2)

> Applies **exclusively to `fine_tuning_pipeline`** (DAG 2). The main `research_lineage_pipeline` runs data quality validation at Task 8 — not bias mitigation.

Llama 3.1 8B is fine-tuned on ancestor paper selection and structured comparison generation. Naive random splitting inflates evaluation metrics because bibliometric signals and lineage graph overlap cause train/test leakage that sample-level deduplication cannot catch.

### Bias 1 — Shared Ancestor Overlap

Different seeds' lineage trees converge on shared papers (e.g. AlexNet, Transformer). A **union-find** algorithm clusters all samples that share any paper ID into the same split, preventing the model from exploiting memorised representations.

| Version | Samples | Clusters | Shared IDs (any split pair) |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 | 184 | 94 | 0 |
| v2 | 293 | 163 | 0 |
| v3 | 392 | 259 | 0 |

### Bias 2 — Popularity Bias

Citation-based filtering risks a spurious popularity-relevance correlation. Citation counts are binned into five quantile tiers (`low / medium / high / very_high / landmark`) used as a stratification axis during splitting. All splits verified within **±7 pp** of the overall tier distribution across all versions.

### Bias 3 — Domain Imbalance

Unconstrained seed selection yields ~65% CS. Three rounds of targeted seed collection rebalanced the corpus:

| Field | v1 (184) | v2 (293) | v3 (392) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Computer Science | 66.8% | 57.7% | 50.5% |
| Physics | 19.0% | 27.0% | 34.9% |
| Mathematics | 14.1% | 15.3% | 14.6% |

Splits use composite keys (domain × tier) to stay within **±5 pp** per field. Math remains underrepresented (~15%) due to sparse S2 coverage — future work includes zbMATH/MathSciNet and lower citation thresholds for math seeds.

CS being over-represented at ~50% is considered an **acceptable structural compromise**: CS algorithms inherently form longer, more densely linked citation chains than physics or math papers, so naive seed sampling will always skew toward CS. Three rounds of targeted rebalancing brought it from 66% → 50%, which is meaningful progress. Rather than force further undersampling now — which would discard valid training signal and inflate fine-tuning cost — the plan is to evaluate model performance across domain slices after fine-tuning and apply corrective resampling only if cross-domain performance gaps are significant.

### Splitting Procedure

1. **Cluster formation** — union-find on shared paper IDs
2. **Cluster profiling** — dominant field, popularity tier, max year, size
3. **Stratified allocation** — composite key (domain × tier), temporal ordering, 70/15/15
4. **Integrity verification** — zero cross-split paper ID overlap confirmed

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

Five GitHub Actions workflows automate testing, training, evaluation, deployment, and rollback.

### Workflows

| Workflow | File | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CI** | `ci.yml` | Push to any branch, PR to main | Lint (ruff), typecheck (mypy), unit tests (pytest), DAG validation |
| **Model Training** | `model-training.yml` | Manual dispatch | Train on Modal (A100), log to MLflow, register model, trigger evaluation |
| **Model Evaluation** | `model-evaluation.yml` | Manual dispatch, eval code changes to main | Run inference + LLM judge scoring, threshold gates, bias check |
| **Deploy** | `deploy.yml` | Manual dispatch | Deploy to Modal (vLLM serving), smoke test, update pipeline state on GCS |
| **Rollback** | `rollback.yml` | Manual dispatch | Roll back to a previous model version, redeploy, notify via email |

### CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

Runs on every push and PR:

```
lint (ruff check) ──┐
typecheck (mypy)  ──┤
test (pytest)     ──┼──→ notify (email, on failure only)
dag-validation    ──┘
```

- **527 tests** across unit and integration suites
- DAG validation uses AST parsing to verify syntax without importing Airflow
- Failure notifications sent via email using `scripts/notify.py`

### Model Training → Evaluation → Deploy Flow

```
model-training.yml                      deploy.yml
┌─────────────────────────┐            ┌──────────────────────┐
│ train (Modal A100)      │            │ deploy (Modal vLLM)  │
│        ↓                │            │        ↓             │
│ log-mlflow    evaluate ─┼──calls──→  │ smoke-test           │
│        ↓                │  model-    │        ↓             │
│ register (GCS registry) │  eval.yml  │ update-state (GCS)   │
└─────────────────────────┘            └──────────────────────┘
```

### Evaluation Gates

The evaluation workflow enforces quality thresholds before a model can be promoted:

| Gate | Metric | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **Classification** | `predecessor_strict` accuracy | ≥ 0.60 |
| **LLM Judge** | `judge_overall` mean score | ≥ 3.0 / 5.0 |
| **Bias** | Max disparity across domain/popularity slices | ≤ 0.15 |

Scoring formula: `Score = 0.75 * Predecessor_soft + (Judge_overall / 5) * 0.25`

### PR Validation Mode

On pull requests, the training, evaluation, and deploy workflows run in **validation mode**:

- **Training**: Skips actual Modal training; validates workflow structure and output wiring
- **Evaluation**: Downloads existing evaluation artifacts from GCS instead of running live inference; threshold and bias gates still execute against real results
- **Deploy**: Skips Modal deployment; verifies required scripts exist and workflow structure is correct

This allows full pipeline verification without incurring GPU costs or long training runs.

### Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `GCP_SA_KEY` | GCP service account key JSON |
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | GCP project ID |
| `GCS_BUCKET_NAME` | GCS bucket (e.g. `researchlineage-gcs`) |
| `MODAL_TOKEN_ID` | Modal authentication token ID |
| `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET` | Modal authentication token secret |
| `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` | MLflow server URI |
| `EVAL_GCS_TEST_PATH` | GCS path to evaluation test data |
| `EVAL_MODEL_ENDPOINT` | Model endpoint for evaluation (gemini-* or Modal URL) |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` / `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP config for email notifications |
| `ALERT_EMAIL_FROM` / `ALERT_EMAIL_TO` | Email sender/recipient for alerts |

---

## Experiment Tracking (MLflow)

MLflow tracks all training runs, evaluation results, and model versions.

### Setup

MLflow runs as part of the Docker Compose stack:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml adds:
mlflow-db:    # Postgres 15 backend (port 5434)
mlflow:       # MLflow server (port 5001, artifact root: gs://researchlineage-gcs/mlflow-artifacts)
```

Access the UI at http://localhost:5001 after `docker compose up`.

### What gets logged

| Event | Logged data |
|---|---|
| **Training run** | LoRA params (r=16, alpha=16), base model, epochs, learning rate, max_seq_length, model GCS URI |
| **Evaluation run** | Classification accuracy, judge scores, semantic similarity, per-slice metrics |
| **Bias report** | Domain/popularity slice metrics, max disparity, pass/fail status |

### Integration points

- `src/mlflow_utils.py` — helper functions (`log_training_run`, `log_evaluation_run`, `log_bias_report`, `register_model`)
- `dags/training_dag.py` — `log_to_mlflow` task runs after training
- `src/evaluation/pipeline.py` — logs metrics in `save_results()` (graceful skip if MLflow unavailable)
- GitHub Actions — model-training workflow logs to MLflow after each run

---

## Model Registry & Rollback

### GCS-based Model Registry

Models are registered in GCS with versioned metadata:

```
gs://researchlineage-gcs/model-registry/
  └── researchlineage-model/
      ├── v20260320_143000/
      │   └── metadata.json    # version, GCS URI, stage, timestamp
      └── v20260315_091500/
          └── metadata.json
```

- `src/registry/artifact_registry.py` — `push_model_to_registry()`, `list_model_versions()`, `promote_model()`
- Models are also registered in MLflow Model Registry for experiment lineage

### Rollback

`rollback.yml` (manual dispatch) rolls back to any previous model version:

1. Updates `pipeline_state.json` on GCS with the target version
2. Redeploys the target model to Modal (vLLM serving)
3. Sends email notification with rollback status

Programmatic rollback: `src/registry/rollback.py` — `rollback_model()`, `get_rollback_candidates()`

---

## Error Handling

Each task raises typed exceptions from `src/utils/errors.py`:

| Exception | Raised by | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `ValidationError` | T1, T2 | Missing required fields, invalid types, >10% error rate |
| `DataQualityError` | T8 | Quality score below 85% threshold |
| `APIError` | T1 | Semantic Scholar / OpenAlex request failure |
| `RateLimitError` | T1 | API rate limit exceeded (429) |

**Graceful degradation:** Redis down → API-only; DB down → API fallback; rate limited → linear backoff (10 retries, up to 275 s); partial API failures → logged and skipped; SMTP absent → alerts silently skipped; PDF 403/404 → removed from retry queue.

---

## Tracking & Logging

All logging is centralised through `src/utils/logging.py`. Every module uses the same entry point:

```python
from src.utils.logging import get_logger
logger = get_logger(__name__)
```

The root logger is auto-configured on first import with a consistent format:

```
2026-02-23 14:32:01 | INFO     | src.tasks.data_validation | Starting validation
2026-02-23 14:32:01 | WARNING  | src.tasks.anomaly_detection | Detected 3 anomalies
```

`LOG_LEVEL` in `.env` controls verbosity (default: `INFO`; set to `DEBUG` for verbose output).

**DAG 1** logs per-task progress, validation results, and cache hit rates via Airflow task logs.

**DAG 2** writes dual output: `INFO`+ to Airflow logs and a full `DEBUG`-level trace to `data/tasks/pipeline_output/pipeline.log`.

---

## Running Tests

Tests are fully isolated — no live API calls, no database connections required.

### Option A: Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t researchlineage-tests .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/reports:/app/reports researchlineage-tests
```

Open `reports/report.html` for the full results dashboard.

Expected result: **527 passed**

The warning is a harmless Pydantic v2 deprecation in `src/utils/config.py` — does not affect functionality.

### Option B: Local

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/ -v
```

### Test coverage

| File | Tests | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `test_data_acquisition.py` | 29 | Input/output validation, reference/citation filtering logic |
| `test_data_validation.py` | 21 | Schema checks, 10% error-rate threshold, self-citation removal |
| `test_data_cleaning.py` | 18 | Deduplication, venue normalisation, referential filtering |
| `test_citation_graph.py` | 18 | Graph construction, metrics, edge cases (empty graph) |
| `test_feature_engineering.py` | 16 | Feature completeness, normalisation, temporal categories |
| `test_schema_transformation.py` | 17 | Field mapping, ArXiv ID extraction, author UUID fallback |
| `test_quality_validation.py` | 21 | Quality checks, referential integrity, 85% quality threshold |
| `test_anomaly_detection.py` | 14 | Z-score outliers, duplicates, disconnected nodes |
| `test_pipeline_e2e.py` | 18 | Full Tasks 2–9 chain, data integrity across stages |
| **Total** | **171** | 153 unit + 18 integration |

---

## Data Versioning (DVC)

DVC tracks raw/processed research data and fine-tuning artifacts. All data is stored in GCS. The remote is pre-configured in `.dvc/config` — no additional setup required.

### Remote

```
gs://researchlineage-gcs/dvc-store
```

Authentication uses the same GCP credentials as the rest of the project (`GCLOUD_CONFIG_DIR`).

### Tracked datasets

| DVC pointer | DAG | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `data/raw.dvc` | `research_lineage_pipeline` | Raw API responses from Semantic Scholar |
| `data/processed.dvc` | `research_lineage_pipeline` | Cleaned, validated, and feature-engineered datasets |
| `data/tasks/pipeline_output/splits.dvc` | `fine_tuning_data_pipeline` | Stratified train / val / test splits (70 / 15 / 15) |
| `data/tasks/pipeline_output/qwen_format.dvc` | `fine_tuning_data_pipeline` | Qwen chat-format training files and metadata sidecars |

`.dvc` pointer files are committed to Git; actual data is not.

### Pull existing data

```bash
dvc pull
```

### Push new data after a pipeline run

> **Note:** Both DAGs automatically upload artifacts to GCS under a timestamped path (`{gcs_prefix}/{run_id}/`) at the end of each run. This is independent of DVC. The steps below are a **manual post-run step** to create a reproducible, git-linked snapshot restorable with `dvc pull`.

**Research lineage pipeline:**

```bash
dvc add data/raw data/processed
dvc push
git add data/raw.dvc data/processed.dvc
git commit -m "Update research lineage datasets"
```

**Fine-tuning pipeline:**

```bash
dvc add data/tasks/pipeline_output/splits data/tasks/pipeline_output/qwen_format
dvc push
git add data/tasks/pipeline_output/splits.dvc data/tasks/pipeline_output/qwen_format.dvc
git commit -m "Track fine-tuning artifacts from pipeline run"
```

### Retrieve data from a specific past run

```bash
git log --oneline data/raw.dvc
git checkout <commit-hash> -- data/raw.dvc
dvc pull data/raw.dvc
```

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Desktop | ≥ 4.x | Running all services |
| Docker Compose | ≥ v2 | Orchestrating containers |
| Python | 3.11.x | Local development / test runs |
| Poetry | ≥ 2.0 | Dependency management |
| DVC | ≥ 3.x | Data versioning |
| GCP account | — | Cloud SQL + GCS (production only) |

---

## Setup & Reproducibility

### 1. Clone and configure environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gautamrajur/ResearchLineage.git
cd ResearchLineage

cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your credentials (see [Configuration Reference](#configuration-reference) for all options):

```bash
# Minimum required to run the pipeline
SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY=your_s2_api_key_here

# Required for fine-tuning DAG
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# GCP path — set to your local gcloud config directory
# Mac/Linux: /Users/<username>/.config/gcloud
# Windows:   C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/gcloud
GCLOUD_CONFIG_DIR=/Users/your-username/.config/gcloud

# Optional: SMTP alerts on anomaly detection
SMTP_USER=your.email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx   # Gmail App Password
ALERT_EMAIL_FROM=your.email@gmail.com
ALERT_EMAIL_TO=alerts@yourdomain.com
```

A free Semantic Scholar API key gives you 100 req/s (vs 1 req/s unauthenticated).

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
poetry install --with dev
```

### 3. Pull versioned datasets

```bash
dvc pull
```

### 4. Start all services

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

This starts:
- **Postgres** (`:5433`) — Airflow metadata database
- **Redis** (`:6379`) — API response cache (48h TTL)
- **Cloud SQL Proxy** (`:5432`) — GCP Cloud SQL tunnel (requires `GCLOUD_CONFIG_DIR`)
- **Airflow webserver** (`:8080`) — UI + REST API
- **Airflow scheduler** — DAG execution engine
- **MLflow** (`:5001`) — Experiment tracking UI (Postgres backend, GCS artifact store)
- **MLflow DB** (`:5434`) — MLflow metadata database

### 5. Initialise Airflow (first run only)

```bash
docker compose run --rm airflow-init
```

Creates the metadata schema and default admin user:
- URL: http://localhost:8080
- Username: `admin` / Password: `admin`

**Reproducibility:** Poetry lockfile for deterministic installs; fixed random seed in `lineage_pipeline.py`; DVC pointers git-linked to every dataset version; PEP 8 via pre-commit hooks.

---

## Running the Pipeline

1. Open http://localhost:8080
2. Find the DAG you want to run and toggle it **on**
3. Click **Trigger DAG** to start

### Stop all services

```bash
docker compose down
```

---
